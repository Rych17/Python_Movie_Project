# Python_Movie_Project
This Python file is the findings of a project theory I have between movie budget and movie rating. 
The hypothesis being tested was that higher movie budgets are correlated with higher movie ratings. 
The data used for the analysis was sourced from Kaggle and comprised of movies that were Marvel versus D.C. released between 2000-2021. 
In the dataset it includes info such as movie title, release date, genre, budget, and rating.
